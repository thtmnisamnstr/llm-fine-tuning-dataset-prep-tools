[SXSW Pitch](https://www.sxsw.com/awards/sxsw-pitch/) (formerly SXSW Accelerator) is the marquee event of [South by Southwest Online](https://www.sxsw.com/), where leading startups from around the world showcase some of the most impressive technology innovations to a panel of hand-picked judges and a virtual audience.

Out of the more than 500 companies that applied to present at SXSW Pitch 2021, RudderStack was selected as one of the 40 finalists.

There are 8 categories this year with 5 finalists in each:  Artificial Intelligence, Robotics & Voice; **Enterprise & Smart Data** _(the category we are in)_; Entertainment,Gaming & Content; Future of Work; Health, Wearables & Wellbeing; Innovative World Technologies; Smart Cities, Transportation & Logistics; and Social & Culture.

The format this year is pretty simple. A 3-minute pre-recorded pitch video and a 5-minute live-recorded Q&A with the judges.
